# Hello!

I'm David, currently a lead gameplay programmer at Cloud Imperium Games where I work on vehicles and related features. I've worked heavily on the spaceship movement systems in Star Citizen. I got to work on this sort of stuff because of a background in physics and maths. A lot of the work I do is with that in mind. I have a [personal website here](https://david-colson.com), where I try and share what I've been learning and working on.

# Personal Projects

- **Athena** A game making toolkit made almost completely from scratch and designed to supplement my knowledge of lower level engine code.
- **UnrealInk** A library that allows the use of Ink, a C# dynamic narrative scripting language, to be used in Unreal. Uses mono and other tricks to make it work
- **RustyRaytracer** A raytracer I've not worked on in a while but intend to get back to. A chance to learn about raytracing and Rust.

I have a bunch of other dormant and abandoned side projects too lying around this account.

# Programming Style

- Strongly believe in simpler is better
- Won't solve problems that don't exist
- Try not to overcomplicate things for the fun of it
- Do my best to understand the problem at hand before tackling a solution
